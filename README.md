# React + Vite

## Installed Dependencies
In this project, I installed dependencies that would help me in building a workable site.  Below are the dependencies installed (with installation setup to drop in terminal). I'm using Vite, so please install as written:

-React
npm create vite. (this setup will walk you through various installs.)

-DynamoDB
npm i -D @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb
These installs will help when using DynamoDB database (Be sure to setup DynamoDB with AWS)

-React Bootstrap
npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap
if using css, please add import bootstrap/dist/css/boo.nelifp. Visit www.react-bootstrap.nelify.app for further assistance.

## Build Project
In this project, I used DynamoDB to help make list for my faux pet adoption center.  Once the database was created and working well, I used frameworks and css to style.

## Tests
To make sure my project was running correctly, I tested several components such as my AnimalModal.jsx and Animal.jsx.  These files hold various information to allow my site to run smoothly.

## Live Site
I pushed my completed and error-free site to GitHub and created a live site using Nelify.  Please check it out https://loviespetcenter.netlify.app.
